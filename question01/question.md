# The Unique Number Detective

## Challenge Scenario
Imagine you're working on a data validation system where you need to identify the one number that stands out in an array of repeated values.

## Problem Description
You'll receive an array of numbers where every number appears multiple times, except for one unique number. Your task is to write a function that finds and returns this singular number.

### Input Example
```javascript
const numbers = [18, 18, 18, 19, 18, 18, 18];
```

### Expected Output
```javascript
// For the input [18, 18, 18, 19, 18, 18, 18], the function should return 19
```

## Evaluation Focus
We'll be looking at:
- Correctness of the solution
- Code clarity
- Performance efficiency
- Problem-solving creativity

## Example Function Signature
```javascript
function findUniqueNumber(numbers) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```
